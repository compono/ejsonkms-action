# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in the changesets repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run:

```bash
npx changeset
```

or

```bash
npm run changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

1. Select the type of change (major, minor, patch)
2. Enter a summary of the change

## Releasing

When you're ready to release:

1. Run `npx changeset version` to update versions and changelogs
2. Run `npm run build` to build the project
3. Commit the changes
4. The GitHub Action will automatically create a release PR or publish
